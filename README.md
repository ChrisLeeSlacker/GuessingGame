# GuessingGame
Simple game I made:
Guess a random number 1-100 and 1-10.

-main.py is for running the login.py
-login.py for the functionality of a login menu
  username = ad
  password = pass
-menu.py is well the menu part with 4 options, player either 1-100, 1-10, Optional Slot for something and Quitting.
-game.py the guessing game with the choices to either play another game, go to menu or quit after finishing a game despite win or lose.
