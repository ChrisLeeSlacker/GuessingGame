# GuessingGame
Simple game I made:  
Guess a random number 1-100 and 1-10.  
  
# Main.py  
For running the login.py  and menu.py
# Login.py  
For the functionality of a login menu  
  username = ad  
  password = pass  
# Menu.py  
The menu part with 4 options:  
1-100  
1-10  
Empty Slot for something  
Quitting    
# Game.py  
The guessing game with the choices to either play another game, go to menu or quit after finishing a game despite win or lose.
